**WhyCook** is a web-based application designed to help my roommate efficiently manage their **recipes** and **ingredients** while showcasing what meals can be prepared based on available items at home. This project is built using **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **MongoDB**, with **Vercel** handling both frontend and backend deployment.


---

## **Project Overview**
WhyCook connects to two **MongoDB databases**:
- **Recipe Database:** Stores information about recipes, including required ingredients.
- **Ingredient Database:** Tracks available ingredients at home.

The **main page** acts as a **live monitor**, displaying recipes that can be cooked based on the available ingredients. Users can easily check what they can prepare in real-time without needing to manually check inventory.

Additionally, there are **dedicated pages for editing recipes and ingredients**, allowing users to:
- Add or update recipes and their ingredient lists.
- Manage the ingredient inventory (add, update, or remove items).

These admin features provide flexibility for managing stock and recipes dynamically.
